This opens the Source Control view where you can initialize a new repository by clicking "Initialize Repository" or typing a commit message and pressing `Ctrl+Enter`. Once initialized, files in your project folder will be tracked by Git, and you can see their status (changed, staged, etc.) in the Source Control view. To make commits, stage the changes you want to include (either by clicking the `+` next to each file or using `Stage All Changes`), enter a commit message in the textbox at the top of the Source Control view, and press `Ctrl+Enter` to commit.

To push changes to GitHub or another remote repository, ensure you have added your remote repository URL. You can do this by clicking on the three dots (`...`) next to "No remotes" in the Source Control view, then selecting "Add Remote." Enter your repository's URL and a name (like "origin"), then press `Enter`. To push your commits, click on the ellipsis (`...`) next to the branch name in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window, select "Push," and choose the branch you want to push. Enter your GitHub credentials if prompted, and VS Code will push your changes to the remote repository. This integration streamlines version control tasks directly within the development environment, enhancing productivity and collaboration for developers using VS Code.
